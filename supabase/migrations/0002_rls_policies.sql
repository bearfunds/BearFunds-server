-- BearFunds server — Row-Level Security (forward-only).
-- Every tenant table is scoped to the session's family_id (auth_family_id()).
-- This is the isolation backstop for brain QA Area 008 (Identity) / Area 019 (Isolation):
-- even if the Edge Function logic is wrong, a session can only read/write its own family.

-- Grants: the `authenticated` role reaches tables only through these policies.

grant select, insert, update, delete
  on public.transactions, public.categories, public.accounts,
     public.entities, public.members
  to authenticated;
grant select on public.families to authenticated;
grant execute on function public.auth_family_id() to authenticated;

-- Enable + FORCE so the table owner is also subject to policies (defense in depth).
